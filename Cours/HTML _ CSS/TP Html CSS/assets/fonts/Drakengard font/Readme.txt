  About the font
===============================================================================
   ----------
--| Features |--
   ----------
This font includes complete character set (lowercase and uppercase letters,
   numbers, punctuation, and accented characters).

Since the artbook and the intro movie only showed so many characters, I had to
   make up corresponding characters for upper or lower case.

The original glyphs are used in:
- In upper case:
  - a, b, d, f, g, h, i, k, l, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, x and y.
- In lower case:
  - a, c, d, e, f, h, i, k, l, m, o, p, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y and z.
- Symbols
  - comma and period.
